# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch game created with HTML, CSS and JS. This was made as a part of the Odin Project's web development course.
I had a lot of fun making this site - it was the first site I used JS on which was interesting and caused numerous headaches at first. :)
I also feel much more comfortable using HTML and CSS now since I've been practining them more. Excited for the next project!
